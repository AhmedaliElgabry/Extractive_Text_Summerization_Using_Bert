<br/>
<br/>
**That is my final project for neural network and Deep learning (CIE 555) course in my university** <br/>
**we have done:**<br/>
• Have used wikihow dataset and do manty Data preprocessing techniques in it - remove stop words,remove unrelated content lemmetization
make the data is suitable format to can feed it in the pretrained model-.<br/>
• Have used Bert-Extractive summerizer pretrained model.<br/>
• Have used Rough-1,Rough-2,Rough-l to compare the model result with state of the art in text Summarization.<br/>
• the model is deployed using Flask <br/>
<br/>

**The comberhansive detailed information about the project is available in Deep Learning Final Project Report.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

**That`s is sample from model output**<br/>
